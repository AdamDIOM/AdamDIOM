## More about me

### Student
I am currently a BSc (Hons) Computer Science Student at the [University College Isle of Man](https://ucm.ac.im) (studying a University of Chester course). 2022/23 is my second year and I am really enjoying juggling four different programming languages this year:
- C++
- Python
- ASP.NET Core (C#)
- Kotlin
on top of Java from first year.

### Volunteering
My favourite way to spend my time is volunteering with the [Isle of Man Code Club](https://codeclub.im). What I do can be split into different categories:
#### CyberCenturion
A competition I am truly passionate about, and took part in myself for 6 years before becoming a team leader, CyberCenturion is a national cyber education initiative for 12-18 year-olds in the UK and UK overseas territories. Through Code Club, we currently lead seven teams of Manx students into the stormy waters of cybersecurity, covering topics such as audit, password security, desktop security and a lot more. The teams can learn a lot just from taking part in one round, where the atmosphere is electric as they work together to solve common and lesser known security flaws.

#### Assets Management
Another one of my roles at Code Club is to be the club's Assets Manager. This entails maintaining our inventory of assets, keeping any software up to date and hardware up and running, as well as looking into purchases for future upgrades and storage options. Through this, I have communicated with potential sponsors and vendors to get the best deals on products, and worked with other companies to curate the best experiences for the youth of today.

#### Teaching
Recently reinvigorated as a lunchtime club through a local primary school, one of my roles is teaching young people how to code. In 2022, I am teaching primary school children in small cohorts how to code using BBC micro:bits. With one 30-minute session a week, I have to come up with concise plans for each session, and then deliver and troubleshoot any errors that occur during the session. This can be especially challenging, especially when this is often the students' first experience coding. Using the micro:bit, however, is an extremely rewarding piece of kit; the students get to see the product of their coding in the real world, not just as flashing lights on a screen.

### Barista
When I'm not studying or volunteering, I like to take a break, not to drink coffee, but to handcraft a range of beverages at local Costa Coffee stores across the Isle of Man. Currently working as a shift leader, but looking to upskill to a Barista Maestro in the coming months.
